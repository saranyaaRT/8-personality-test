:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::“THE VIRTUOSO”:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I wanted to live the life, a different life. I didn’t want to go to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. I wanted interesting challenges.
VIRTUOSOs love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, !VIRTUOSOs find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.
VIRTUOSO personality
VIRTUOSOs explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don’t even mind them getting into their space. Of course, that’s on the condition that those people don’t interfere with VIRTUOSOs’ principles and freedom, and they’ll need to be open to VIRTUOSOs returning the interest in kind.!
VIRTUOSOs enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care about, and it’s a shame they’re so uncommon, making up only about five percent of the population. VIRTUOSO women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit – they’ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age.!
While their mechanical tendencies can make them appear simple at a glance, VIRTUOSOs are actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies, VIRTUOSO personalities can be a challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones. VIRTUOSOs can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions.!
VIRTUOSOs’ decisions stem from a sense of practical realism, and at their heart is a strong sense of direct fairness, a "do unto others" attitude, which really helps to explain many of VIRTUOSOs’ puzzling traits. Instead of being overly cautious though, avoiding stepping on toes in order to avoid having their toes stepped on, VIRTUOSOs are likely to go too far, accepting likewise retaliation, good or bad, as fair play.

The biggest issue VIRTUOSOs are likely to face is that they often act too soon, taking for granted their permissive nature and assuming that others are the same. They’ll be the first to tell an insensitive joke, get overly involved in someone else’s project, roughhouse and play around, or suddenly change their plans because something more interesting came up.!
Finding an environment where they can work with good friends who understand their style and unpredictability, combining their creativity, sense of humor and hands-on approach to build practical solutions and things, will give VIRTUOSOs many happy years of building useful boxes – and admiring them from the outside.!
CAREERS THAT BEST SUITS YOU:
VIRTUOSO CAREERS
The VIRTUOSO personality type is probably the hardest to pin down in many aspects of life, but especially in their careers. VIRTUOSOs thrive on diversity and unpredictability, on wondering “what’s next?” every morning. This makes VIRTUOSOs one of the most mysterious personality types, but also one of the most versatile in the professional world.!
VIRTUOSOs are born problem-solvers with an unwavering focus on practical solutions (though perhaps not always solutions to practical problems). No other type is quite as fascinated by how things work, how tools can be used, and how facts can be put together to create immediate and satisfying results. This combination of curiosity and hands-on vigor make people with the VIRTUOSO personality type excellent mechanics, engineers, graphic designers, and forensic scientists.!
"Practical" is the word of the day. But it’s not the practicality of routine administration that VIRTUOSOs crave – they need variety and action, perhaps even a little adrenaline in their work. Highly structured environments leave VIRTUOSO personalities bored and tired. Jobs that focus on crisis response, such as firefighters, paramedics, detectives, pilots and police officers seem made for VIRTUOSOs.
VIRTUOSOs have a natural skill with troubleshooting, a relaxed, self-confident nature and a results-oriented focus. People with this personality type understand that risk equals reward, and as long as they can use that understanding with maturity, rather than just kicking the ant’s nest whenever they get bored, they are highly desirable in any dynamic field or environment.!
VIRTUOSO STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
VIRTUOSO strengths
Optimistic and Energetic – VIRTUOSOs are usually up to their elbows in some project or other. Cheerful and good-natured, people with the VIRTUOSO personality type (especially Assertive ones) rarely get stressed out, preferring to go with the flow.
Creative and Practical – VIRTUOSOs are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, and crafts. Novel ideas come easily, and they love using their hands to put them into action.!
Spontaneous and Rational – Combining spontaneity with logic, VIRTUOSOs can switch mindsets to fit new situations with little effort, making them flexible and versatile individuals.
Know How to Prioritize – This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but VIRTUOSO personalities are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it’s needed most.!
Great in a Crisis – With all this hands-on creativity and spontaneity, it’s no wonder that VIRTUOSOs are naturals in crisis situations. People with this personality type usually enjoy a little physical risk, and they aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty when the situation calls for it.
Relaxed – Through all this, VIRTUOSOs are able to stay quite relaxed. They live in the moment and go with the flow, refusing to worry too much about the future.!
VIRTUOSO weaknesses
Stubborn – As easily as VIRTUOSOs go with the flow, they can also ignore it entirely, and usually move in another direction with little apology or sensitivity. If someone tries to change VIRTUOSOs’ habits, lifestyle or ideas through criticism, they can become quite blunt in their irritation.
Insensitive – VIRTUOSOs use logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to quite come out right, if anything is even said at all.!
Private and Reserved – VIRTUOSO personalities are notoriously difficult to get to know. They are true introverts, keeping their personal matters to themselves, and often just prefer silence to small talk.
Easily Bored – VIRTUOSOs enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things long-term. Once something is understood, VIRTUOSOs tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting.!
Dislike Commitment – Long-term commitments are particularly onerous for VIRTUOSOs. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in VIRTUOSOs’ romantic relationships.
Risky Behavior – This stubbornness, difficulty with others’ emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. VIRTUOSOs have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation.!
VIRTUOSO RELATIONSHIPS
When it comes to romantic relationships with VIRTUOSOs, it’s a bit like nailing Jell-O to a tree. Dating VIRTUOSO personalities is a tango, complex and interesting, with alternating coldness and detachment, and passion, spontaneity and enjoyment of the moment
If Songs Could Change Lives, We’d All Love Each Other!
Early in dating, people with the VIRTUOSO personality type can be especially flighty – they live in the present, always looking for new activities and experiences. If a potential partner doesn’t measure up, VIRTUOSOs have no real problem walking away. VIRTUOSOs also need a great deal of personal space, both physically and mentally, and any attempts to control them or forcibly schedule their activities only accelerates their departure.!
On the other hand, VIRTUOSOs have no problem trying to change their partners’ habits, most likely with attempts to get them to loosen up a bit and relax and have fun. VIRTUOSO personalities are hardly strict or traditional when it comes to dating, and often try to introduce sex into their activities early on. Sensual individuals that they are, VIRTUOSOs make ready use of all of their senses, viewing intimacy as an art, a performance, and a source of pleasure.!
This applies in a broader sense in VIRTUOSOs’ relationships as well. Any attempts to push understood arrangements, even the relationships themselves, into open discussion in order to secure commitment, especially early on, are often met by VIRTUOSOs with something close to panic. Nothing is so acutely terrifying to VIRTUOSOs as knowing that there’s no way out. Every day is a new day, and VIRTUOSOs review their obligations from moment to moment.!
If VIRTUOSOs are to be lifelong partners, it must happen as a natural progression of these day-to-day decisions, on their own time.
None of this should be taken too personally by VIRTUOSOs’ partners – it’s just how their minds work. People with this personality type live in the present, in a world of physical activities that engage the senses, and they just need to know that they have the freedom to be passionate about something one day and indifferent the next, without being grilled on when they’re going to finish something, or why they’ve "suddenly changed their minds".!
VIRTUOSO FRIENDS
When it comes to friendships, VIRTUOSOs seem made for Bushnell’s Law of game design: Easy to learn, difficult to master. With their well-rounded and interesting array of hobbies, people with the VIRTUOSO personality type have no trouble at all making acquaintances to share their activities with. It’s getting beneath the surface to become VIRTUOSOs’ true friends that is the real challenge, leaving them with a lot of good will and friendly faces to call on, but only a few people who they feel truly understand them.!
As long as everyone keeps things relaxed and flexible though, VIRTUOSOs’ friendships can be rich and rewarding. People with this personality type are talented when it comes to using their senses, and usually enjoy a little competition. This makes VIRTUOSOs’ hobbies, especially the more physical activities like fishing and crafts, especially enjoyable with a little company, and they are usually the basis for their friendships. VIRTUOSOs’ interests are pretty diverse, so they should have no trouble coming up with exciting things to do.!
VIRTUOSO personalities are also thoughtful, rational people. Being fairly creative individuals themselves, they often enjoy discussing new ideas – but in the end, the point of sharing those ideas needs to be to take action. Dreaming is well and good, but talk is cheap, and discussions on abstract or distant subjects like Eurasian politics can only hold VIRTUOSOs’ attention for so long before they decide to shift their focus to something they can do.!
I Never Set Out to Be Weird, and yet...
VIRTUOSOs are unusually popular, almost in spite of themselves. Their open-mindedness, interesting hobbies and relaxed attitude are attractive to a remarkably broad range of personality types. With so many acquaintances, VIRTUOSOs are sure to strike up deeper friendships with at least a few.!
