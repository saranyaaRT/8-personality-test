::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::MEDIATOR:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
MEDIATOR personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, MEDIATORs have an inner flame and passion that can truly shineAll that is gold does not glitter; not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither; deep roots are not reached by the frost.!
At their best, these qualities enable MEDIATORs to communicate deeply with others, easily speaking in metaphors and parables, and understanding and creating symbols to share their ideas. The strength of this intuitive communication style lends itself well to creative works, and it comes as no surprise that many famous MEDIATORs are poets, writers and actors. Understanding themselves and their place in the world is important to MEDIATORs, and they explore these ideas by projecting themselves into their work.!
MEDIATORs have a talent for self-expression, revealing their beauty and their secrets through metaphors and fictional characters.
MEDIATORs’ ability with language doesn’t stop with their native tongue, either – as with most people who share the Diplomat personality types, they are considered gifted when it comes to learning a second (or third!) language. Their gift for communication also lends itself well to MEDIATORs’ desire for harmony, a recurring theme with Diplomats, and helps them to move forward as they find their calling.!
Luckily, like the flowers in spring, MEDIATOR’s affection, creativity, altruism and idealism will always come back, rewarding them and those they love perhaps not with logic and utility, but with a world view that inspires compassion, kindness and beauty wherever they go.
CAREERS THAT SUITS YOU BEST:
MEDIATOR CAREERS!
It is perhaps more challenging for MEDIATORs to find a satisfying career than any other type. Though intelligent, the regimented learning style of most schools makes long years earning an advanced degree a formidable undertaking for people with the MEDIATOR personality type – at the same time, that’s often what’s needed to advance in a field that rings true for them. MEDIATORs often wish that they could just be, doing what they love without the stress and rigor of professional life.!
Oftentimes, as with so many things, the answer lies somewhere in the middle, in a line of work that begins with passion and dedication, but which comes to require training so that the academia feels intimately linked to that passion. Too many MEDIATORs drift in frustration, ultimately succumbing to the necessities of day-to-day life in a job that wasn’t meant for them. But it turns out that, despite such exacting demands, modern economics places a premium on the very keys to MEDIATORs’ challenges: their creativity, independence, and need for meaningful relationships with individuals who need their help.
Most any cause, idea, or field can benefit from the artful and natural expression that MEDIATORs bring to the table, and MEDIATORs have their pick of the world in choosing who they work with.!
The real beauty here is that it takes a core interest that people with the MEDIATOR personality type share, while helping a cause they believe in, independently, through creative expression and personal growth, and makes it applicable to any interest there is. There will always be a need, and now more than ever, to win people’s hearts and minds with the written word.!

Some MEDIATORs will prefer a still more personal touch, being able to work face-to-face with clients, seeing that their personal effort really impacts another’s quality of life. Service careers such as massage therapy, physical rehabilitation, counselling, social work, psychology and even academic roles and retraining can be exceptionally rewarding for MEDIATORs, who take pride in the progress and growth they help to fosterIf to Do Were as Easy as to Know What Were Good to Do...!
Where MEDIATORs will not thrive is in a high-stress, team-heavy, busy environment that burdens them with bureaucracy and tedium. MEDIATORs need to be able to work with creativity and consideration – high-pressure salespeople they are not. It can be a challenge to avoid these roles, as they are the basis for so much starting work, and it’s often a risk to break away into something less dependable, but more rewarding. To find a career that resonates with MEDIATORs’ values though, that’s more than just a job, sometimes it’s just what needs to be done.
MEDIATOR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
MEDIATOR strengths
Idealistic – MEDIATORs’ friends and loved ones will come to admire and depend on them for their optimism. Their unshaken belief that all people are inherently good, perhaps simply misunderstood, lends itself to an incredibly resilient attitude in the face of hardship.!
Seek and Value Harmony – People with the MEDIATOR personality type have no interest in having power over others, and don’t much care for domineering attitudes at all. They prefer a more democratic approach, and work hard to ensure that every voice and perspective is heard.
Open-Minded and Flexible – A live-and-let-live attitude comes naturally to MEDIATORs, and they dislike being constrained by rules. MEDIATORs give the benefit of the doubt too, and so long as their principles and ideas are not being challenged, they’ll support others’ right to do what they think is right.
Very Creative – MEDIATORs combine their intuitive nature with their open-mindedness to allow them to see things from unconventional perspectives. Being able to connect many far-flung dots into a single theme, it’s no wonder that many MEDIATORs are celebrated poets and authors.!
Passionate and Energetic – When something captures MEDIATORs’ imagination and speaks to their beliefs, they go all in, dedicating their time, energy, thoughts and emotions to the project. Their shyness keeps them from the podium, but they are the first to lend a helping hand where it’s needed.
Dedicated and Hard-Working – While others focusing on the challenges of the moment may give up when the going gets tough, MEDIATORs (especially Assertive ones) have the benefit of their far-reaching vision to help them through. Knowing that what they are doing is meaningful gives people with this personality type a sense of purpose and even courage when it comes to accomplishing something they believe in.!
MEDIATOR weaknesses
Too Idealistic – MEDIATORs often take their idealism too far, setting themselves up for disappointment as, again and again, evil things happen in the world. This is true on a personal level too, as MEDIATORs may not just idealize their partners, but idolize them, forgetting that no one is perfect.
Too Altruistic – MEDIATORs sometimes see themselves as selfish, but only because they want to give so much more than they are able to. This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they try to push themselves to commit to a chosen cause or person, forgetting to take care of the needs of others in their lives, and especially themselves.!
Impractical – When something captures MEDIATORs’ imagination, they can neglect practical matters like day-to-day maintenance and simple pleasures. Sometimes people with the MEDIATOR personality type will take this asceticism so far as to neglect eating and drinking as they pursue their passion or cause.
Dislike Dealing With Data – MEDIATORs are often so focused on the big picture that they forget the forest is made of individual trees. MEDIATORs are in tune with emotions and morality, and when the facts and data contradict their ideals, it can be a real challenge for them.!
Take Things Personally – MEDIATORs often take challenges and criticisms personally, rather than as inspiration to reassess their positions. Avoiding conflict as much as possible, MEDIATORs will put a great deal of time and energy into trying to align their principles and the criticisms into a middle ground that satisfies everybody.
Difficult to Get to Know – MEDIATORs are private, reserved and self-conscious. This makes them notoriously difficult to really get to know, and their need for these qualities contributes to the guilt they often feel for not giving more of themselves to those they care about.!
MEDIATOR RELATIONSHIPS
MEDIATORs are dreamy idealists, and in the pursuit of the perfect relationship, this quality shows strongest. Never short on imagination, MEDIATORs dream of the perfect relationship, forming an image of this pedestalled ideal that is their soul mate, playing and replaying scenarios in their heads of how things will be. This is a role that no person can hope to fill, and people with the MEDIATOR personality type need to recognize that nobody’s perfect, and that relationships don’t just magically fall into place – they take compromise, understanding and effort.!
MEDIATOR romantic relationships
Love All, Trust a Few, Do Wrong to None
Fortunately these are qualities that MEDIATORs are known for, and while it can be a challenge to separate long-fostered fantasy from reality, MEDIATORs’ tendency to focus their attention on just a few people in their lives means that they will approach new relationships wholeheartedly, with a sense of inherent value, dedication and trust.!
As a relationship takes hold, people with the MEDIATOR personality type will show themselves to be passionate, hopeless romantics, while still respecting their partners’ independence. MEDIATORs take the time to understand those they care about, while at the same time helping them to learn, grow and change. While MEDIATORs are well-meaning, not everyone appreciates what can come across as constantly being told that they need to improve – or, put another way, that they’re not good enough. MEDIATORs would be aghast to find that their intents were interpreted this way, but it’s a real risk, and if their partner is as averse to conflict as MEDIATORs themselves, it can boil under the surface for some time before surfacing, too late to fix.!
MEDIATOR FRIENDS
. The challenge is the many dualities that this type harbors when it comes to being sociable – MEDIATORs crave the depth of mutual human understanding, but tire easily in social situations; they are excellent at reading into others’ feelings and motivations, but are often unwilling to provide others the same insight into themselves – it’s as though MEDIATORs like the idea of human contact, but not the reality of social contact.!
MEDIATOR friends:
How Poor Are They That Have Not Patience
In a lot of ways, this limits the potential pool of friends to other Diplomat types, who are able to pick up on the subtle clues left by their MEDIATOR friends, and who are more likely than not to enjoy something of a human enigma. 
To top it all off, ideas like networking and "the friend of my friend is my friend" hold little weight with MEDIATORs. Friendships are earned on their own merit, by dint of the intuitive respect MEDIATORs have for those with similar principles and values, rather than more practical alignments like those of coworkers.! But, if MEDIATORs’ shields are properly navigated and they decide to open up and trust another person, a strong, stable friendship will ensue, marked by passionate support and idealism, subtle poetic wit, and a level of emotional insight that is hard to match. Even as friendships grow stronger and deeper, and friends are lulled into a sense of mutual understanding, MEDIATORs’ enigmatic qualities will never truly vanish.!
